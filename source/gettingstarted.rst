Installing the Monitoring Agents
--------------------------------

RLCatalyst Command Centre uses monitoring agents that run on the individual machines being monitored. Monitoring Agents can be installed manually or via an automated way through RLCatalyst.

**Install Agents through RLCatalyst**

RLCatalyst installs monitoring agents in the target nodes on which the Business Services are running. This is done via a bootstrapping process which will install system monitoring, app monitoring and services monitoring agents into the instances. Once installed, the real-time monitoring alerts will be available under RLCatalyst Command Centre→Services and RLCatalyst Command Centre→Monitoring Tools .

 1.    Login to <customer name>neo.rlcatalyst.com with the given credentials -> Go to Work zone.    
 2.	   Click on the tree on the left to choose the Organization, Business Group, Project and   
        Environment. By default, there will be  
		o Organization with the customer name   
        o Business Group ‘DevOps’ 
		o Project ‘Demo Project’   
        o Environments - <customer name>_EVL,  
          <customer name>_DEV,   
          <customer name>_QA, 
		  <customer name>_PROD, 
		  <customer name>_DEVOPS   
 3.    Choose one of the environments   
 4.    Click on ‘Import’ button. Enter the IP address of the instance, credentials and Import. The agents will be installed automatically when imported.

*Note: The checks added for monitoring your services in Consul should be tagged/grouped properly with the business service name that has to be listed in the Dashboard View. RL Team will provide necessary help to get the service checks added*
